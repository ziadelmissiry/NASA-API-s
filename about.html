    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my personal project! As part of my university coursework, I created this website to showcase my skills and knowledge in web development. The initial concept for the website was provided by my professor as a project assignment for my university coursework. However, I took ownership of the project and infused my own creativity and technical expertise to bring the idea to life. I was highly motivated to create a unique and engaging platform that would showcase my skills and contribute to my academic success</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing APIs, manipulating data, and designing user-friendly interfaces. I enjoyed the process of building this website and learning new techniques along the way. This project not only helped me to improve my technical skills, but also allowed me to express my creativity and passion for space exploration.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy exploring the wonders of space through my project.</p>
